# *Project Proposal*

## *Project Idea*

I am going to build something that combines a calendar and a task manager. 

## What will the application do?

The application has two main features. First, the sidebar allows users to input tasks they need to complete. Unlike a common to-do list, when users input tasks in the sidebar, they must include a date, ensuring that daily tasks are presented on the sidebar each day. The second feature is a calendar view, similar to Google Calendar. What I really want to emphasize is the interaction between these two components, where users can drag and drop tasks into the calendar, making time-blocking much more intuitive.

## Who will use it?

When it comes to time management/productivity apps, there are two types of people: those who want to keep it simple and just use Google Calendar for everything, and those who geek out on Notion, spending more time managing their time than actually doing what needs to be done. I aim to offer something in the middle—providing a bit more functionality while keeping it simple.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

Well, I am really interested in time management software myself, and I've been using Notion daily for the past five years. While it offers a lot of functionality for an all-in-one experience, realistically, I don't need much of it. Based on my observation, many of my friends don't seem to use those features either. So, I'm aiming to build something that hits the sweet spot between simplicity and functionality—something I would actually use myself.

## *User Story*

- As a user, I want to add tasks to my to-do-list

- As a user, I watn to remove taks from my to-do-list

- As a user, I want to assign a date and time to my tasks

- As a user, I want to be able to see my the tasks in need to do in a calendar view

- As a user, I want to have my task sync to my calendar without me having to manually enter it

- As a user, I want to be able to save my list to do. (if I choose to do so)

- As a user, I want to be able to access the list to do I saved previous everytime I login to the app. (if I choose to do so)
